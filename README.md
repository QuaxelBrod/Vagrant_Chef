#Vagrant_Chef
---

This Project is to learn something about
- Vagrant
- Chef (using chef-solo)

Maybe I will add some words for you to follow my learnings. You are welcome to give me input or ask questions.
But remind this is a learning for me I try to share.

##Prerequires

First you need a hypervisor. I use VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/ 
Then you need Vagrant. Find it here: https://www.vagrantup.com/
Just install it anywhere. Under Windows check the default path. You may want to change it.
