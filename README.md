#Chapter 2
Adding some more features
---

## do some additional usefull magic
There are many cookbooks around. Hopefully we do not need to download them and maintain them on out own. Think the chef server
witch is simulated by chef solo should do all this stuff.
Lets start
### Add some tools (tools is all we need ;) )
On the command line install bundler:
`gem install bundler`
With bundler you can setup project specific gems. gems are like librarys for ruby. So one can enssure that if someone 
checkout the project all you need is to run bundle install and all ruby libraries are up with the right version.
