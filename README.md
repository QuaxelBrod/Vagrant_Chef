#Vagrant_Chef
---

This Project is to learn something about
- Vagrant
- Chef (using chef-solo)

Maybe I will add some words for you to follow my learnings. You are welcome to give me input or ask questions.
But remind this is a learning for me I try to share.

Here I trie to note my experience to setup vagrant and chef. In the first steps I use selfcontained configurations. 
That means, I can put all things I need for dedicated Projects to a subdirectory, where all vagrant and chef things 
live. If someone else checks out this project all he need is to call vagrant up on the commandline and there is a 
functional environment for development..
